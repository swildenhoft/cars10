# cars10
Cars10 is a CS:GO stats bot that pulls data from steams API. This is my first codeing project, so could properly be a lot cleaner code. But hey, it works!

1. Add bot token to TOKEN ="Insert here"
2. Run bot in your channel
3. Type !addnew in your channel <br>

5. The users steamlink is now stored in steamid.json file <br>
