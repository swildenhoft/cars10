# cars10
Cars10 is a CS:GO stats bot that pulls data from steams API. This is my first codeing project, so could properly be a lot cleaner code. But hey, it works!

1. Add bot token to TOKEN ="Insert here"
2. Run bot in your channel
3. Type !addnew in your channel
4. Type your steamlink: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/xxxxxxx
5. The users steamlink is now stored in steamid.json file
6. Type !stats to see your all time stats in CS:GO
7. Type !lastmatch to see last match's stats

Enjoy!

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
